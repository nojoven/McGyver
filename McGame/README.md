#Project 3 

This is the third Openclassrooms project in this Python path. 
Now we have to code a video game using the Pygame framework where McGyver has to escape from a labyrinth. The exit door is protected by a vilain whose purpose is to kill McGyver if he tries to reach the door.

That's why Mac Gyver must neutralize the gatekeeper. There are three items in the labyrinth that can be combined to make a syringe ether. They are a plastic tube, a bottle of ether ans a needle. The serynge will be used to make the villain sleep.  

So Mc Gyver must found the three items before meeting the guardian. If he meets the villain before having the three items we lose the game (McGyver dies).
If we gather the three items before meeting the boss he will not prevent us to reach the exit door so when we reach it we win.

The project is hosted in a github repository. It contains:

- A folder for the images 

- A folder for the model (the configuration file)

- The classes (it is an OOP project) with game.py being the main class used to run the game.
There is a class for the constants (constants.py), a class for the characters (McGyver and the villain),
a class for the items and a class for the labyrinth.

- The README file that you are currently reading.
